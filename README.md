# misc_js

I'll be using this repo as a place to put miscellaneous JavaScript/HTML/CSS work that I've done.

### clock.html
Using the HTML5 canvas and JavaScript, I wrote a program that will create an analog clock. I've seen some tutorials out there for a similar type of thing but I tried to mostly do this my own way. The interesting part was probably the trigonometry involved with translating the current time to drawing the hour and minute hands.
